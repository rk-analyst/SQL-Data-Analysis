# Database design, creation and analysis of Instagram database
This repo is a MySQL Instagram Database clone and includes some Challenges to play with the data.
Concepts applied while working on this project : 
- Indexing (clustered and non-clustered) of fields to optimize read queries.
- Usage of different constraints like Primary key, Composite key, Foreign key, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.
- Junction tables to establish many to many relationship between two tables.
- JOINS (INNER and LEFT).
